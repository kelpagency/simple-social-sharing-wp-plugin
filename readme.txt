A social sharing plugin that's accessible, performant, and looks good.

== Description ==

Social sharing buttons that are performant, accessible, and have a ton of customization features built-in. Choose your sharing icon design ranging from rounded, squircles, or just basic icons. Display them in a vertical layout for a sidebar or horizontally with your main content.

=== Performant and Accessible? ===

The icons are built using inline SVG and CSS. By using the native `title` attribute within the SVGs allows for screen readers to know what each button is. The plugin only requires 1 HTTP request for loading the external stylesheet. Simple? We think so.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/simple-social-sharing-kelp` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
1. Add the widget to any widget area and customize as desired

== Screenshots ==

2. Customizing the widget using the WordPress Customizer
3. Squircles is just a fun word to say
